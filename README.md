This repository details the projects that I worked with in my intermediate OOP course at Cornell College.

##nbody

nbody is a java class that simulates the movement of multiple planets around each other.  The base code was provided by my professor, but most of it was written and edited by me.

##simple

This java class was provided by my professor, I did not edit it at all.

##smallworld

This java class was used to test our understanding of graphs.  I took a file of actors and movies and created a vizualization of how far each actor is from Kevin Bacon.
